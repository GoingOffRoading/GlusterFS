# GlusterFS Docker Container
For use in Docker & Kubernetes

## Problem Being Solved
In my GlusterFS journey, there have been gaps that have been dificult to fill:
* No documentation in the [Gluster Docker Hub container registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/gluster/gluster-centos)
* The related [Git repository has not been updated in two years](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-containers)
* [Issues for the Gluster Docker Image(s) are not being addressed](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-containers/issues)
* As of October 2021, [GlusterFS is up to it's August 2021 v9.4 release](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/release-notes/9.4/) but the [Gluster Git/Docker Container is capped at it's March 2018 v4.0 release](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-containers)
* Gluster Client crashes on run, [no documentation](https://github.com/gluster/gluster-containers/tree/master/gluster-client)

# Todo:

* Populate a Docker-Compose example
* Clean up the Kubernetes example
